# Making Data From Observation & Sensing


Observation and sensing can be powerful ways to capture spatial qualities that are not already packaged as readily available datasets. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to create our own dataset using [Epicollect 5](https://five.epicollect.net/), a free and easy-to-use web and mobile data-gathering platform. 

For the purposes of this tutorial, we will demonstrate data collection for a project documenting grafitti in Soho, Manhattan during the turbulent summer of 2020. 


## Setting Up Your EpiCollect 5 Account and Project 

Go to the [Epicollect 5 Website](https://five.epicollect.net/) and click log in on the top right corner. When redirected to the sign in page, use your columbia email to set up your account.

Once you have logged in, click `Create Project` from the top menu, and start to fill out the form with essential information describing your project. Keep the access settings to private.

**Tutorial Deliverable:** 

TBD

<!-- Before the beginning of the next class, create a spatial dataset that doesn't yet exist, but that can be produced through a single short session of field work or archival research. **Produce a simple map illustrating your work and upload it to the Deliverables folder.**

Your dataset can be produced using any combination of the methods above, and again, is not expected to be overly detailed or time-consuming to produce. The most important thing is that the subject of your data be interesting enough to you to continue working on as you develop your final project for the class. In the next session we'll use the datasets you create to explore strategies for static visualization. -->
