## Collecting & Mapping

### Due: 2/5

### What

Create a vector dataset of point locations through field work using the GPS receiver of a cell phone. The points should represent the locations of some *thing* (object, phenomena, landmark) that you encounter in the immediate surroundings of your everyday life. Design a map of the dataset you created.

<!-- 

### How

Begin by reading through Tutorial 3 which walks you through how to create an account, and set up a new 'form' or data collection tool using Epicollect. Unlike previous weeks there is not a separate deliverable for tutorial 3, instead you will need to use it as a resource for creating your own data gathering instrument. 

After you have a grasp on the process of setting up a form to collect data then:

- Decide on what you would like to collect data about
- Write out what information you would like to collect about each point location (these will become the fields in the attribute table of the new dataset you are creating)
- Design a form to collect point locations and each of the attribute fields you are interested in using the Epicollect website and app described in [Tutorial 3](/methods-in-spatial-research-sp2021/tutorials/tutorial03/). 
- Collect your data
- Export it as a CSV file, and create a map of it in QGIS

### Requirements

- Collect at least fifteen data points, or as many as is necessary to convey what you hope to in your map.
- Locate base layers to provide a background and context for your collected data (if you are unable to locate any existing datasets use a web service base map)
add links to more than just stamen
- Design a map that conveys graphically/visually some aspect of the experience of being in the midst of the phenomena you were collecting



### Format

- Your final map must be a designed map composition on a single slide with a 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080 pixels). You are encouraged to select one of the map examples discussed thus far during class (either in [lecture slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tQHHcbWB65EVjiqt-9ajyd5sVMHPuzls&authuser=db2672%40columbia.edu&usp=drive_fs) or during a [group exercise](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1f39yOn8mfryxkJdiHvaqJ3zQGA8elu47&authuser=db2672%40columbia.edu&usp=drive_fs)) and imitate its graphic style. 
- Your designed map composition must include:
  - title
  - legend
  - scale bar
  - north arrow (your map doesn't need to have north pointing vertically...)
  - citations for all data sources  
  - projection used
  - your name

*"Data are always collected for a specific purpose, by a combination of people, technology, money, commerce, and government."* (Kurgan 2013, 35)

### The main task

Find two digital spatial datasets about a place (that is **not** New York City) that are related to a topic that interests you and have some relevance to one another. Create a single map which uses these two datasets together to make an argument that was likely not intended by the original creator(s) of either dataset.


### Requirements

- The place you select must be somewhere that you have lived and/or spent a significant enough amount of time to know something about lived experience there.

- I suggest working with vector datasets for this assignment (but not required). When looking for vector geospatial data you should be looking for one of these file types:
  - shapefile
  - geojson
  - KML/KMZ
  - a csv with latitude and longitude coordinates (review tutorial 2 for how to open something like this)
- if you plan to use raster data you should be looking for something with a '.tif' format or that is called a 'geoTIFF' or 'geoJPG'

- Investigate the origins of your two datasets. Some starting points to cover (at a minimum): who made the data? what is/was the intended use(s) the data? when was the data made? how was it made? 

- Research the appropriate projected coordinate reference system to use for your chosen place

- Consider the role that the title and other map elements can play in assisting you in making your argument clear

### Format

- Your final map must be a designed map composition on a single slide with a 16:9 aspect ratio. You are encouraged to select one of the map examples discussed on 1/15 and imitate its graphic style. 
- Your designed map composition must include:
  - title
  - legend
  - scale bar
  - north arrow (your map doesn't need to have north be pointing vertically...)
  - citations for all data sources 
  - projection used
  - your name

### Submission

- Upload your map:
  - as a pdf to Canvas
  - add it to the pin-up Google Slides presentation for 1/29 in the course Google Drive folder

### Starting points/guidance
